# Wishlist Error Fix - Summary

## Problem
When a user was deleted directly from the database, their wishlist remained. This caused an error when trying to display wishlists because the code tried to access the `name` property of a null user object.

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (server.js)
**File:** `Backend/server.js`

**Change:** Updated the `/api/wishlists` endpoint to filter out wishlists with deleted users:
```javascript
// Get all wishlists
app.get('/api/wishlists', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const wishlists = await Wishlist.find().populate('user', 'name email').lean();
        
        // Filter out wishlists where user was deleted (null/undefined)
        const validWishlists = wishlists.filter(wishlist => wishlist.user != null);
        
        res.json(validWishlists);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Get wishlists error:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error' });
    }
});
```

### 2. Frontend Safety Check (wishlist.html)
**File:** `Frontend/wishlist.html`

**Change:** Added validation in the `displayAllWishlists` function to filter out any invalid wishlists:
```javascript
// Filter out any wishlists with null/undefined users
const validWishlists = wishlists.filter(wishlist => {
    if (!wishlist || !wishlist.user || !wishlist.user.name) {
        console.warn('Skipping invalid wishlist:', wishlist);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
});
```

### 3. Cleanup Script
**File:** `Backend/cleanupOrphanedWishlists.js`

Created a standalone script to remove orphaned wishlists from the database:
- Checks all wishlists in the database
- Identifies wishlists belonging to deleted users
- Removes the orphaned wishlists
- Provides a summary report

**Usage:**
```bash
cd Backend
node cleanupOrphanedWishlists.js
```

### 4. Admin Cleanup Endpoint
**File:** `Backend/server.js`

Added an admin-only API endpoint for cleaning up orphaned wishlists:
```javascript
POST /api/admin/cleanup-wishlists
```

This allows admins to clean up orphaned data without running a separate script.

### 5. Updated README
**File:** `README.md`

Added documentation about:
- Setup instructions
- Database maintenance procedures
- How to clean up orphaned wishlists

## Results

✅ **Cleanup Results from Database:**
- Total wishlists found: 8
- Valid wishlists: 7
- Orphaned wishlists deleted: 1

## Prevention

The existing user deletion endpoints already clean up wishlists:
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:userId` - Deletes user's wishlist with `Wishlist.deleteOne()`
- `DELETE /api/admin/children/:childId` - Deletes child user's wishlist

**Note:** The orphaned wishlist was likely created because the user was deleted directly from the database (via MongoDB Compass or similar tool) instead of using the API endpoint.

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always use the API endpoints to delete users** - This ensures proper cleanup of related data
2. **Run the cleanup script periodically** if users are deleted directly from the database
3. **The backend now automatically filters out orphaned wishlists** so the error won't occur again, but running cleanup removes them permanently

## Testing

After implementing these fixes:
1. ✅ Backend filters out wishlists with null users
2. ✅ Frontend has additional validation as a safety net
3. ✅ Cleanup script successfully removed 1 orphaned wishlist
4. ✅ Wishlist page should now load without errors
