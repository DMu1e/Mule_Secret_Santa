# Child User Login Feature - Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the application to allow child users to login with a default password while hiding the Assignment link from their sidebar navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### `Backend/models/User.js`
- **Updated password field**: Changed `required` from conditional (`function () { return !this.isChild; }`) to always `true`
  - Child users now must have a password to enable login
- **Updated pre-save hook**: Removed the special case that skipped password hashing for child users
  - All users (including children) now have their passwords hashed consistently

#### `Backend/server.js`
- **Updated child user creation endpoint** (`POST /api/admin/children`):
  - Added `password: 'password'` as the default password for all newly created child users
  
- **Updated login endpoint** (`POST /api/login`):
  - Added `isChild` to the JWT token payload
  - Added `isChild` to the user response object
  
- **Updated profile endpoint** (`GET /api/user/profile`):
  - Added `isChild` field to the profile response

#### `Backend/updateChildPasswords.js` (NEW)
- Created migration script to update all existing child users with the default password "password"
- Successfully updated 15 child users:
  - Dalton, Andrew, Achsar, Adel, Boaz, Nzivarae, Roy, Ryan, Ruby, Jeremy, Becky, Neala, Nziva, Babu, Shosho

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### `Frontend/dashboard.html`
- **Added CSS class**: Added `assignment-link` class to the Assignment navigation item
  
- **Updated `checkUserRole()` function**:
  - Added logic to hide assignment links for child users
  - Uses JWT token payload to check `isChild` flag
  - Hides all elements with class `assignment-link` when user is a child

## How It Works

### For Child Users:
1. **Login**: Child users can now login using:
   - Username: Their name (e.g., "Dalton")
   - Password: "password" (default)

2. **Dashboard Access**: After login, child users see:
   - ✅ Profile
   - ✅ Wishlists
   - ✅ Logout
   - ❌ Assignment (hidden)
   - ❌ Admin Controls (hidden, unless they're also admin)

3. **Token**: JWT token includes `isChild: true` flag

### For Regular Users:
- No changes to existing functionality
- Can still see and access the Assignment link
- Login process remains the same

### For Admin Users:
- Can create new child users through the admin interface
- New child users automatically get default password "password"
- Admin controls remain visible to admins

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Login as a child user (e.g., username: "Dalton", password: "password")
2. Verify dashboard loads successfully
3. Verify "Assignment" link is NOT visible in sidebar
4. Verify other links (Profile, Wishlists, Logout) are visible
5. Test creating a new child user as admin
6. Verify new child user can login with password "password"

## Security Considerations

### Default Password:
- ⚠️ All child users share the default password "password"
- This is intentional for ease of use in a family/trusted environment
- Consider documenting this in user guides

### Recommendations:
1. If child users need individual security, consider:
   - Adding a password change feature for child users
   - Allowing parents to set custom passwords for their children
   - Implementing a "first login" password change requirement

2. For production use in a less trusted environment:
   - Generate unique random passwords for each child user
   - Email passwords to parent users
   - Implement password strength requirements

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `Backend/models/User.js` - User model schema
- `Backend/server.js` - API endpoints and authentication
- `Backend/updateChildPasswords.js` - NEW migration script

### Frontend:
- `Frontend/dashboard.html` - Sidebar navigation and role checking

## Migration Steps for Production

If deploying to production:

1. **Stop the server**
   ```bash
   # Stop your running server
   ```

2. **Run the migration script**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   node updateChildPasswords.js
   ```

3. **Verify the update**
   - Check that all child users were updated
   - Test login with a child user account

4. **Deploy updated code**
   - Deploy the modified backend and frontend files

5. **Test in production**
   - Verify child users can login
   - Verify assignment link is hidden for child users

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Backend**: Revert changes to `User.js` and `server.js`
2. **Frontend**: Revert changes to `dashboard.html`
3. **Database**: Child users will need email and login disabled again if reverting

Note: Passwords are hashed and cannot be unhashed, so reverting requires recreating child users without passwords.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add ability for parents to manage child user passwords
2. Add password change functionality for child users
3. Add "forgot password" flow for child users via parent email
4. Add age-appropriate content filtering based on child age
5. Add parental controls for what child users can access
