# Cluster-Based Gift Assignment System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive cluster-based gift assignment system with enhanced randomness to prevent users in the same cluster from gifting to each other, with special rules for users with maxGifts > 1.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Cluster Data Model
**File: `Backend/models/User.js`**
- Added `cluster` field to User schema (String, nullable)
- Allows users to be grouped into named clusters
- Users without a cluster assignment are considered "Unassigned"

### 2. Cluster Management API Endpoints
**File: `Backend/server.js`**

#### GET `/api/admin/clusters`
- Returns all clusters with their members
- Groups users by cluster name
- Returns format: `{ "ClusterName": [users...], "Unassigned": [users...] }`

#### PUT `/api/admin/users/:userId/cluster`
- Updates a single user's cluster assignment
- Body: `{ cluster: "ClusterName" }` or `{ cluster: null }` to unassign

#### POST `/api/admin/clusters/bulk-update`
- Updates multiple users' cluster assignments in one request
- Body: `{ updates: [{ userId, cluster }] }`
- Returns success/failure for each update

### 3. Enhanced Assignment Algorithm
**File: `Backend/generateSantaAssignments.js`**

#### New Features:
1. **Shuffle Function (Fisher-Yates Algorithm)**
   - Adds true randomness to Santa selection
   - Prevents predictable assignment patterns

2. **Cluster-Based Sorting**
   - Santas in larger clusters are assigned first (more constrained)
   - Recipients with fewer possible Santas are assigned first
   - Adds randomness within same constraint levels

3. **Cluster Restrictions**
   - Users in the same cluster cannot gift to each other
   - Enforced during Santa selection and validation

4. **Cluster Diversification for maxGifts > 1**
   - When a Santa has maxGifts > 1, the algorithm actively tries to assign recipients from different clusters
   - Scores potential recipients, penalizing those from clusters already assigned to this Santa
   - Validation ensures no Santa gives multiple gifts to the same cluster

5. **Enhanced Randomness**
   - Shuffles possible Santas before sorting by assignment count
   - Adds random tiebreakers when scores are equal
   - Prevents deterministic patterns in assignment

#### Algorithm Flow:
```
1. Load all users
2. Sort Santas by cluster size (descending) + randomness
3. Sort recipients by constraint level (ascending) + randomness
4. For each recipient:
   a. Filter valid Santas (not self, not same cluster, capacity available)
   b. Shuffle possible Santas for randomness
   c. Score Santas based on:
      - Current assignment count (lower = better)
      - Cluster diversification (for maxGifts > 1)
      - Random tiebreaker
   d. Select best-scored Santa
5. Validate all assignments:
   - No same-cluster gifting
   - No duplicate recipients
   - No cluster duplication for maxGifts > 1
   - All maxGifts limits respected
```

### 4. Validation Rules

#### Cluster Validation:
- ✅ Santa and recipient cannot be in the same cluster
- ✅ For Santa with maxGifts > 1: Cannot give to multiple people in the same cluster
- ✅ All existing restrictions still apply (excludedUsers, includedUsers, etc.)

#### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Basic Cluster Restriction**
```
Cluster A: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
Cluster B: [David, Eve]

❌ Alice → Bob (same cluster)
✅ Alice → David (different cluster)
✅ Alice → Eve (different cluster)
```

**Scenario 2: maxGifts with Cluster Diversification**
```
Cluster A: [Alice, Bob]
Cluster B: [Charlie, David]
Cluster C: [Eve, Frank]

Santa: Grace (maxGifts = 2)
✅ Grace → Alice, Grace → Charlie (different clusters)
❌ Grace → Alice, Grace → Bob (both from Cluster A)
```

### 5. Admin UI for Cluster Management
**File: `Frontend/gift-restrictions.html`**

#### Features:
- **Cluster Creation**: Create new clusters by name
- **Visual Cluster Display**: Shows all clusters with their members
- **Drag-and-Drop Style Management**:
  - Add users to clusters from dropdown
  - Remove users from clusters (moves to "Unassigned")
  - Delete entire clusters (moves all members to "Unassigned")
- **Unassigned Users Section**: Shows users without cluster assignment
- **Save Functionality**: Bulk save all cluster changes to database

#### UI Components:
- Cluster boxes with colored borders
- Member badges with remove buttons
- Dropdown selectors to add users
- Clear visual distinction for child users (👶 emoji)
- Success/error messaging

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Basic Cluster Restriction
```
Setup:
- Create Cluster "Family1" with users A, B, C
- Create Cluster "Family2" with users D, E
- All users have maxGifts = 1

Expected:
- User A cannot be assigned to gift to B or C
- User A can be assigned to gift to D or E
- All users receive exactly one gift
```

### Test Case 2: Cluster Diversification
```
Setup:
- Cluster "A" with users [1, 2, 3]
- Cluster "B" with users [4, 5, 6]
- User "Santa" (not in any cluster) with maxGifts = 2

Expected:
- Santa should be assigned to users from different clusters
- If Santa → User1 (Cluster A), then Santa → User4/5/6 (Cluster B)
- Never: Santa → User1, Santa → User2 (both from Cluster A)
```

### Test Case 3: Large Cluster Constraint
```
Setup:
- Cluster "Big" with 10 users
- Cluster "Small" with 2 users
- All users have maxGifts = 1

Expected:
- Users in "Big" cluster should be processed first (most constrained)
- Valid assignments found even with large cluster restrictions
- No same-cluster assignments
```

### Test Case 4: Mixed Constraints
```
Setup:
- Clusters as above
- Some users with excludedUsers restrictions
- Some users with maxGifts > 1

Expected:
- All cluster rules respected
- All excludedUsers rules respected
- Cluster diversification for maxGifts > 1
- Algorithm completes successfully or provides clear error
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:

1. **Access Cluster Management**
   - Navigate to Gift Restrictions page
   - Cluster Management section appears at the top

2. **Create Clusters**
   - Enter cluster name in the input field
   - Click "Create Cluster" button
   - Examples: "Smith Family", "Office Team", "College Friends"

3. **Assign Users to Clusters**
   - Find the cluster box
   - Select a user from the dropdown
   - Click "Add" button
   - User moves from "Unassigned" to the cluster

4. **Remove Users from Clusters**
   - Click the "×" next to a user's name in a cluster
   - User moves back to "Unassigned"

5. **Delete Clusters**
   - Click "Delete" button on cluster box
   - Confirm deletion
   - All members move to "Unassigned"

6. **Save Changes**

7. **Generate Assignments**
   - Navigate to Santa Assignments page
   - Click "Generate Assignments" or "Regenerate"
   - Algorithm automatically applies cluster rules

### For Users:
- No changes to user experience
- Cluster assignments are transparent to regular users
- Gift assignments respect cluster rules automatically

## Benefits

### 1. Family-Friendly
- Perfect for family gatherings where nuclear families shouldn't gift within themselves
- Example: Smith family members don't gift to each other, only to other families

### 2. Office Secret Santa
- Separate teams/departments into clusters
- Ensures cross-team gifting and networking

### 3. Friend Groups
- Keep roommates or close friend groups from gifting to each other
- Encourages broader social connections

### 4. Flexibility
- Users can belong to no cluster (participate without restrictions)
- Clusters can be any size
- Mix and match with existing maxGifts and excludedUsers features

### 5. Enhanced Randomness
- Fisher-Yates shuffle ensures true randomness
- No predictable patterns
- Different results each time algorithm runs

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- Algorithm complexity: O(n² * attempts) where n = number of users
- Increased attempts (100) ensures success even with complex constraints
- Cluster sorting reduces failed attempts by handling constrained cases first

### Randomness Implementation
- Fisher-Yates algorithm for uniform random distribution
- Multiple randomization points in the algorithm
- Random tiebreakers prevent deterministic patterns

### Error Handling
- Clear validation messages
- Explains why assignments fail
- Suggests solutions (e.g., "increase maxGifts")
- Graceful fallback for impossible scenarios

## Files Modified

### Backend:
1. `Backend/models/User.js` - Added cluster field
2. `Backend/server.js` - Added cluster management endpoints
3. `Backend/generateSantaAssignments.js` - Complete algorithm overhaul

### Frontend:
4. `Frontend/gift-restrictions.html` - Added cluster management UI and logic

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments:

1. **Database Migration**
   - No migration needed - cluster field is optional
   - Existing users will have `cluster: null` (unassigned)
   - System works with or without clusters

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - All existing features still work
   - Cluster restrictions are additive
   - Users without clusters behave as before

3. **Gradual Adoption**
   - Can deploy without creating any clusters
   - Create clusters as needed
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Cluster Templates**: Pre-defined cluster structures
2. **CSV Import**: Bulk import cluster assignments
3. **Cluster Stats**: Show cluster size distribution
4. **Auto-Clustering**: AI-based cluster suggestions
5. **Cluster Visualization**: Graph view of clusters
6. **Cluster History**: Track cluster changes over time

## Troubleshooting

### "No valid assignments found"
**Cause**: Cluster restrictions too tight for the number of users
**Solution**: 
- Reduce cluster sizes
- Increase maxGifts for some users
- Remove some cluster assignments

### "Santa cannot give to multiple people from the same cluster"
**Cause**: User with maxGifts > 1 has limited options
**Solution**:
- Ensure enough cluster diversity
- Increase number of clusters
- Ensure clusters are balanced in size

### Cluster changes not saving
**Cause**: Backend server not running or authentication issue
**Solution**:
- Check backend server is running
- Verify admin authentication
- Check browser console for errors
